## Description 

This folder holds the frontend server, which is ReactJS. The main work and compontents of the frontend can be found inside `src/App.js` and `src/MapChart.js`. 

## Requirements

- Ensure that you have `NodeJS` installed with version `v17.8.0`. 
    - To check your current version, run the following command `node --version`
    - If the correct version is not installed, you can use `nvm` to run the proper version. You can run `nvm install stable --reinstall-packages-from=current` . That should install the latest version.
- Ensure that you have `npm` installed with version `8.5.5`

## Installing the packages and running the frontend
- Open the terminal in that folder. 
- Install the packages required for the frontend `npm install`.
- Start the frontend server by running `npm start` in the terminal.
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to confirm that your frontend server is working.

***Important Note: You need to ensure that the Backend works appropriately to use the web application.***
